## Develop Azure compute solutions


### major groups of the exam

- Develop Azure compute solutions (25-30%)
- Develop for Azure storage (10-15%)
- Implement Azure security (15-20%)
- Monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize Azure solutions (10-15%)
- Connect to and consume Azure services and third-party services (25-30%)



### Develop Azure compute solutions (25-30%)
- Implement container-based applications
- Implement Azure app service web apps
- Implement Azure functions

### Implement container-based applications (10-15%)
- Create and manage container images for solutions
    - ACR task provides a way to build for platforms including Linux, Windows, and ARM directly in Azure, and automate OS And framework patching for your docker images
    - ACR task support several scenarios to build and maintain your container images and other artifacts:
        - Quick Task
        - Automatically trigger tasks
        - Multi-step task
- Discover the azure container registry (ACR)
    - Use the azure container registry to service with your existing container development and deployment pipeline, or use azure container registry tasks to build images directly in azure
    Use cases
        - Scalable orchestration system that manages containers applications across cluster of hosts (Kubernetes)
        - Azure services that support building and running applications at scale
    - Azure container registry services tiers
        - Basic
        - Standard
        - Premium  
- Azure Container Instance (ACI)
    - There are two common ways to deploy a multi-container group: ARM template or a YAML file
    - Resource allocation: Azure Container Instance allocates resources such as CPUs, memory, and optionally GPUs to container group by adding the resource requests fo the instance in the group.
    - Container groups share the ip address and a prot namespace on that ip, so network rules can be simplify fired.
    - Specify external volumes to mount within a container group
    - Map those values into specific paths within the individual containers group
    - Multi-containers groups are useful in cases where you want to divide a single functional task into a small number of container images. 
- Publish an image to the Azure Container Registry

### Create solution by using Azure Container Apps
- Major use cases
    - Deploy API endpoints
    - Host background processing endpoints applications
    - Handle event driven processing 
    - Run microservices
- Dynamically scale based on:
    - CPU utilization & Memory utilization
    - Event - driven processing
    - HTTP Traffic
    - Any KEDA supported trigger

### Create an Azure App server web app
    - An app service plan defines a set of compute resources for a web app to run.
    - One or more apps can be configured to run on the same computing resources (or in the same app service plan)
    - Scaling only works in the standard and all the tier up, and is based on computed or memory usage.
    - All of the web apps in the service plan are leaving different service plans, so you can scale them independently.
    - CI/CD is supported for Azure Devops, Github, Bitbucket, FTP or a local git repository.
    - Deployment slots are easily added for your web apps, and you should have staging, testing, development, and production slots.
    - App Service on linux, hosts web apps natively on linux for supported application stacks,.and you can not mix windows and linux apps in the same app service plan.
### Enable Diagnostic logging
    - when configure connection strings adding and editing connection strings follow the same principles as other app settings and they can also be tied to deployment slots.
