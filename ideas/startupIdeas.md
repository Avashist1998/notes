# StartUp Ideas 
- Author: Paul Graham

Three things that must be present in a start up idea
 - Something the founders themselves want
 - that they themselves can build 
 - that few other realize are worth doing

## Problems 
One of the most common mistake people make is solving a problem that does not exists. Example Paul build a online art galleries and people did not want to pay for it because that is not how art is done.
The term used for this kind of doubly dangerous ideas is "made-up" or "sitcom". This is like if there was a sitcom and the character need to be a startup founder, so the written will make up something for them. 
## Well
Paul recommends us to build something for a small number of people want a large amount. Question to ask yourself: who wants this ring now? who wants this so much that they'll use it even when it's a crappy version one made by a two person startup they've never heard of? Focus on creating depth of your idea not need.
## Self
Once the initial niche is defined you want to figure a path out of it. One has th live in the leading edge as a user. `Live in the future, then build what's missing.` Prime example is Facebook and how Mark used the internet so much that knew what was missing. The verbs you want to look out for "think up" but "notice". Since a successful startup will consume at least 3-5 years of your life, a year's preparation would be a reasonable  investment. You want to be both a programmer(creator) and the target user, because then the cycle of generating new versions and testing them on users can happen inside one's head.
## Noticing 
Ideas are out there because in the next 5 year you will be looking around and thinking "What did I do before x?" You can start by questioning the status quo, for example why do we have an inbox, and why does it overflowing? This will make you pay attention to things that chafe you. Keep a background process running, looking for things that seem to be missing. Work on hard problems, driven mainly by curiosity, but have a second self watching over your shoulder, taking notes of gaps and anomalies. A trick that one can use is to work on projects that seem like they'd be cool. That way you will want to build things that are missing.
`Live in the future and build what seems interesting`
## School
If you are CS major you might do better to get a sumer job in some unrelated field, or just build stuff. Hopefully with other students that way you'll end up producing not just organic ideas, but organic ideas with organic founding team. 
## Competition
It is very rare for competition to kill a start up idea. Ask your user, because if they want something now then you have idea. Beach Head focus on the user not the competition. Make your idea into a phrase like `we're going to make an x that doesn't suck`. Classic example is Google, because the search engine at the time was shied away from the most radical implications of what they were doing. It is better to bet on a good idea with competitors than a bad on without. 
## Filters
Unsexy filter - all developers want to work on nice, clean ideas but the world is messy. If you look at the messy boring world you will find tedious ideas 
Schlep filter - strips is an example of that where a lot of people did not want to deal with payments and since they were scared of it they did not think of creating a payment service like stripe. This lead stripe in acquiring customers easily because people where waiting for them to build this.
Do not say away from schlep ideas because all startups will have a schleps involved.
## Recipes
1) look at things that you are good at : database, Chat App
2) find things that you need, and ask yourself why don't someone make x? 
3) Try asking yourself whether your needs are different from the rest of the people?
4) Look at your previous idea and see if you need something when you were working on them
5) Talk to people and learn about there problems and what are something they would like to see solved. Try to ask them general ideas.
6) A good way to get pass the unsexy and schlep filter is to ask yourself what is something that you want someone else to build.
7) Look at dying companies and see what could grow from their death? Don't look for a replacement for x; look for something that people will later say turned out to be a replacement for x.
8) Look for a wave that you can ride that is bigger than your startup, and ask yourself how can your startup benefit from it.
## Organic
Looking for waves is essentially a way to simulate organic ideas. It is good to have the time and inclination to build things just because they're interesting.
