Understanding of the team



I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineering position at your Luminate. With two years of experience developing web applications using REST APIs and microservice architecture, along with a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Science and a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering focused on Information Systems and Sciences, I am confident that my background and skillset make me an ideal candidate for this position.

I have had the opportunity to work on the Log Application team at Argo AI, where I developed software to manage the company's AI pipelines and video pipelines. My experience includes working extensively with AWS and Apache Airflow, creating DAGs for presentation generation, and building APIs in Java using the Spring Boot Framework. Additionally, my role as an AI/ML Developer at PCS Software involved leveraging Azure Cognitive Services to create a user-specific voice assistant and working with Azure functions to run custom Microsoft SQL queries. I also worked on creating arm templates to set up testing, development, and production environment drivers. As the first AI engineer to be hired at PCS Software, I had the opportunity to work directly under the Chief Technology Officer, which allowed me to hone my leadership, communication, and presentation skills.

During my undergraduate and graduate years, I participated in various organizations and groups. Notably, I developed a random forest regression model during the Tamu Datathon, which predicted equipment failure from sensory data. I applied Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and limited the number of features that decreased the complexity of the model. The model maintained an accuracy above ninety-five percent while decreasing the feature space from 170 to 66 features. This experience contributed significantly to my initial interest in data science and machine learning.

I am excited about the opportunity to speak with the team during the interview process and believe that my technical and personal skills will add value to your company. Please feel free to contact me by phone or email if you require further information. References are available upon request.

Thank you for considering my application.
