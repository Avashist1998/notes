Qualcomm office is really nice in San Diego and they have shuttle services from hotel to all buildings. They booked my flight tickets from NY to CA and they booked nice hotel in San Diego and food reimbursement is also generous. Offices have gym, swimming pool in it. Personally, I don’t think they ask tough interview questions as they are not proper CS company. Overall my experience is very good with Qualcomm. Waiting for result now.
